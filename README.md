# My Personal Project
### What is it?
For my personal project I have decided to create an application which will serve as a **multiple-choice question quiz 
maker**. The application can be used as a survey creator, a testing tool, or a studying tool. I consistently find myself
always trying to find ways to test my understanding prior to going into large assessments such as midterms or finals in 
order to get a glimpse into how well my understanding on topics covers the lecture course content. Understandably a 
great way to fix this issue is to create an application specifically for making multiple-choice question quizzes. The 
application would **mainly serve to help students** who are trying to prepare for tests or other activities, however,
there are no true bounds to its uses.

### How will it work? 
The application will allow a user to create and save multiple quizzes. Furthermore, there will be no bounds as to how
many questions must be in one quiz and the application will allow you to save and load all quizzes previously worked on.
The user will also be able to edit and delete individual quizzes, as well as the questions inside of them. They will
have options to set the correct answer (answers if there are more than one) for individual questions and upon 
completion of making the quiz the user can then prompt a new panel in which they can take the quiz they just created.
After they've taken the quiz the can check their quiz statistics to see how well they did on the quiz and whether they
should retake it to improve their understanding. Furthermore, every time they reopen the application the quiz statistics
section of the quiz will reset for the user, but the quizzes and questions will remain in the same state as before.
The application should serve as a great tool for users, whether they are trying to study, survey, or test their 
fellow peers.
